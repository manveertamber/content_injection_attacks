5	The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists
6	The polar bear population has been growing.
9	Ironic' study finds more CO2 has slightly cooled the planet
10	Human additions of CO2 are in the margin of error of current measurements and the gradual increase in CO2 is mainly from oceans degassing as the planet slowly emerges from the last ice age.
11	They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide.
14	The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing the most widespread bleaching ever recorded
18	it’s not a pollutant that threatens human civilization.
19	If CO2 was so terrible for the planet, then installing a CO2 generator in a greenhouse would kill the plants.

36	When the exact same group of 'experts' who claimed it was global cooling in 1977 now claim it's global warming you can easily see why I am skeptical
38	Scientists studying Antarctica sea ice warn a rise in accumulation could spark the next ice age.
41	More than 500 scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have sent a 'European Climate Declaration' to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
42	Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.
44	Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors [of climate change], but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one.
51	CO2 does not cause climate change, it RESPONDS to it [...]
55	[T]he raw data, the actual thermometer data[...] shows that the US has been cooling for 80 to 90 years.
57	Earth’s mean temperature over the last 2,000 years shows two previous periods when temperatures were warmer than they are now; from 1–200 A.D., an epoch called the Roman Warm Period, and more recently the Medieval Warm Period from 900–1100 A.D.
60	So that means that probably about half, maybe half of that nine-tenths of the degree [of total warming] might be caused by greenhouse gases
61	[NASA] has been adjusting temperatures from the past[...]
65	A windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it.
67	Fifty-five thousand years ago the whole world was 2°C warmer than it is today[...]
69	Sea level rise is not going to happen.
71	Cold weather to grip world as solar minimum to deepen, NASA says
72	[O]ne of the previously fastest shrinking glaciers in the world is growing again, calling into question the narrative that rapid climate change [...]
74	The models predicted about three times the amount of warming in the world we’ve seen since [1988].
75	The science is clear, climate change is making extreme weather events, including tornadoes, worse.
76	Burping cows are more damaging to the climate than all the cars on this planet.
77	[S]unspot activity on the surface of our star has dropped to a new low.
79	The rate of warming according to the data is much slower than the models used by the IPCC
82	The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years
85	Sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2
86	There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for their claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase.
87	NOAA has adjusted past temperatures to look colder than they were and recent temperatures to look warmer than they were.
91	They were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records
93	unadjusted data suggests that temperatures in Australia have only increased by 0.3 degrees over the past century, not the 1 degree usually claimed
95	[climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.
96	The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sort of the voice of the consensus, concedes that there has been no increase in extreme weather events.
97	according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined
98	Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.
99	Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.
100	'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.
101	Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.
102	Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.
103	global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature
104	Increases in atmospheric CO2 followed increases in temperature.
105	Therefore, CO2 levels could not have forced temperatures to rise.
108	sea-level rise is not accelerating.
109	Local and regional sea levels continue to exhibit typical natural variability—in some places rising and in others falling.
113	The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted.
118	more than 100 per cent of the warming over the past century is due to human actions
120	90 per cent of the world's coral reefs will disappear in the next 35 years due to coral bleaching induced by global warming, pollution and over-development.
123	the warming is not nearly as great as the climate change computer models have predicted.
126	El Niño drove record highs in global temperatures suggesting rise may not be down to man-made emissions.
127	Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty.
128	Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated.
129	Sea level rise could reach six or seven feet by the year 2100.
132	Climate change is not making natural disasters worse
133	The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska
135	Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s
137	Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture
138	As a result, half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct.
139	And in January, one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change.
141	Greenpeace didn’t save the whales, switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did
142	Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.
143	Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed
148	Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out.
152	“Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.
157	Contemporary Global Warming placed in geological context.
161	Extreme melting and changes to the climate like this has released pressure on to the continent, allowing the ground to rise up.
163	We’ve contacted them to ask more details about the size of the Sif.
164	Small increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days, and those hot days have a big impact.
165	When the Emergency Leaders for Climate Action approached the Federal Government in April they were drawing on decades of data showing that fire conditions are getting worse.
168	As the temperature has increased, so has the ability of scientists to determine whether specific events are linked to climate change.
169	They can now model how likely a specific event would be to occur under historical conditions, compared to the record temperatures we’re experiencing.
171	We’ll still be facing extreme heat, but at a far more manageable level than if we’d done nothing to halt climate change.
173	If there were [carbon emissions], we could not see because most carbon is black.
180	Reef material is calcium carbonate, which contains 44 per cent carbon dioxide.
181	Reefs need carbon dioxide; it’s their basic food.
184	It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.
185	Modellers assume carbon dioxide drives climate change
189	The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas
190	Climate change is normal and continual.
194	The main greenhouse gas is water vapour[…]
195	Carbon dioxide is a non-condensable atmospheric gas like nitrogen and oxygen
196	Without carbon dioxide, all life on Earth would die
197	Plants need almost three times today’s carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere to thrive.
198	For decades horticulturalists have pumped carbon dioxide into glasshouses to increase yields.
199	In the past, warming has never been a threat to life on Earth.
200	if we halved today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide content, all life would die.
203	In our lifetime, there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature
204	after a natural orbitally driven warming, atmospheric carbon dioxide content increases 800 years later
207	Each of the six major past ice ages began when the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.
211	For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect.
214	A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.”
216	[The 1990 IPCC report said] that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable
220	Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods
230	In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves.
235	The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C)
236	global temperatures have risen between 0.23F (0.13C) and 0.34F (0.19C) per decade
237	However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast
240	In 1990 the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F (0.3C) per decade.
243	In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010.
244	But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.
246	at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.
248	But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour, which makes 95 per cent of the total.
250	CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.
254	it’s virtually impossible to get funded for work that disputes climate change through other channels [other than oil companies]
256	One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age.
257	The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today
258	But the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming.
261	in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC – Jonathan Overpeck – wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’
263	it later emerged that its creator Dr Michael Mann had spliced too [sic] datasets together – tree-rings showing temperatures going back hundreds of years, then recent thermometer readings for the more recent decades.
266	The IPCC no longer includes the ‘Hockey stick’ chart in its reports.
267	Yet a study published just this week, by the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway, found that the natural climate system can change abruptly, without the need for any external forces.
268	Some scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America, Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity.
272	The melting ice has led to global sea level rise of around eight inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880.
275	until temperature increases began to slow down after 1998 and remained relatively stable for a period of 15 years
279	In one particularly damning email, CRU director Phil Jones said he had used ‘Mike’s Nature trick’ to ‘hide the decline’ in temperatures in the second half of the 20th century.
281	In an interview with the BBC after the scandal broke, Dr Jones admitted there had been no statistically significant global warming since 1995
282	The panel was forced to retract a statement in its 2007 report saying all Himalayan glaciers could melt entirely by 2035.
284	The figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed.
287	Climate skeptics argue temperature records have been adjusted in recent years to make the past appear cooler and the present warmer, although the Carbon Brief showed that NOAA has actually made the past warmer, evening out the difference.
293	When the measuring equipment gets old and needs replacing, it often requires re-calibration.
294	A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message.
296	The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.
298	Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.
302	In addition, [climate models] ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial
305	There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] floods
306	There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] droughts
307	For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests
310	[data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter
311	there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,
313	Let’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be.
316	the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed
319	Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.
320	Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.
322	The first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated, by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships’ water intake.
331	But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder, which increases the warming trend.
332	Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often, and darker stations absorb more of the sun’s energy.
335	Last month was the hottest June ever recorded, European satellite agency announces
337	temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.
338	Rapid assessment of average temperatures in France between 26-28 June showed a “substantial” increase in the likelihood of the heatwave happening as a result of human-caused global warming, experts at the World Weather Attribution group said.
340	Heatwaves occur in any climate, but we know that heatwaves are becoming much more likely due to climate change.
342	While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story
343	They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms, that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases, and that they didn’t expect that situation to change in the near future.
344	Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods.
348	There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S.
349	Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally.
350	Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase.
351	And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.
353	The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather
356	This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities, as learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks.
357	With that in mind, they propose a plausible and terrifying “2050 scenario” whereby humanity could face irreversible collapse in just three decades.
358	Their analysis calculates the existential climate-related security risk to Earth through a scenario set 30 years into the future.
362	North America suffers extreme weather events including wildfires, drought, and heatwaves.
363	Monsoons in China fail, the great rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls by half.
365	The knock-on consequences affect national security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic disease outbreaks, are overwhelming.
366	Armed conflicts over resources may become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war.
368	The most recent IPCC report lays out a future if we limit global heating to 1.5°C instead of the Paris Agreement’s 2°C.
369	By 2050 there’s a scientific consensus that we reached the tipping point for ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic
373	Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes.
375	when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.
376	whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.
377	If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.
378	for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion.
381	[subsidies for wind and solar] add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine.
382	The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives.
383	“As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable.
386	Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.
388	We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit.
390	there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.
392	a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming
398	nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.
399	Climate Change ‘Heat Records’ Are a Huge Data Manipulation
400	The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.
401	On Feb. 7, several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record.
404	Actual weather records over the past 100 years show no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.
409	as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease.
412	From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement.
413	However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase.
418	describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040
419	But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.
420	International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.”
424	Duffy pointed out that his chart was from a single tide gauge station, near San Francisco, and that sea levels rise at different rates around the world
428	Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing.
430	“But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing.
432	Climate scientists use the 20th-century average as a benchmark for global temperature measurements.
434	It’s also a sufficiently long period to include several cycles of climate variability.
435	NOAA’s analysis found last month was the 3rd-warmest April on record globally.
436	The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.
441	For the year-to-date, the Earth is seeing its 5th-warmest start to the year.
442	There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of Global Warming
443	“Today climate scientists are obsessed with the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a very very small part of the overall picture.
444	Carbon dioxide is a trace gas.”
446	It’s not carbon dioxide, it’s not methane… Scientists estimate that somewhere between 75% and 90% of Earth greenhouse effect is caused by water vapor in clouds.”
447	“Every day, nature puts twenty times as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of Earth industries.
449	So it’s clear now we’re not seeing dangerous global warming, and the climate models are wrong.
450	If we double atmospheric carbon dioxide[…] we’d only raise global surface temperatures by about a degree Celsius.
451	The idea that the much smaller carbon dioxide cycle is now controlling the water cycle is not very likely.
452	“So the bottom line of all this is that climate change is natural, not man-made.
454	Man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.”
455	Climate scientists are telling us it’s likely we’re going to be in for a period of cooling.
457	temperatures rise and they fall, and they rise and they fall… and for the last 400 years we’ve had a gentle warming as we’ve been coming out of the little ice age.
461	Temperatures cooled from about 1940 to 1975, and then they rose from about ’75 to about 2005 or so, and since then they’ve been flat or cooling.
463	“So now we’re able to explain from natural factors how we’ve had the 20th Century warming.
467	This is the South Pole ice, 90% of Earth’s ice, and it’s getting thicker.
469	Ocean levels have been rising for the last 20,000 years[…] No climate scientist can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man-made sea level rise began.
470	According to NASA, the globally averaged temperature of the land and ocean was 0.9˚C (1.62˚F) above the 20th century average.
473	La Niñas, on the other hand, feature cooler than average waters in the Pacific
474	Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic.
477	Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions
478	Protecting and restoring forests would reduce 18% of emissions by 2030
482	It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests.
484	“We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.
487	“It’s horrifying that we’d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change.
488	Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”
490	IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments
492	But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns
493	Coastal lake sediments along the Gulf of Mexico shoreline from 1,000 to 2,000 years ago suggest more frequent and intense hurricanes than occur today.
494	The Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 experienced a Category 3 or 4 storm, with up to a 20-foot storm surge.
495	While such a storm does not happen in New England anymore, it happened again there in 1675, with elderly eyewitnesses comparing it to the 1635 storm.
496	Nine years into that 11-year hurricane drought, a NASA scientist computed it as a 1-in-177-year event.
498	The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time.
499	The monetary cost of damages has increased dramatically in recent decades, but that is due to increasing population, wealth and the amount of vulnerable infrastructure.
502	But abnormal temperature spikes in February and earlier this month have left it vulnerable to winds, which have pushed the ice further away from the coast than at any time since satellite records began in the 1970s.”
503	“During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.
506	More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.
508	Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic
512	water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate
516	For the past 4567 million years, the sun and the Earth’s orbit have driven climate change cycles.
519	Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale
520	Just 1.25 per cent of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere-ocean system has been released by ­humans in the past 250 years.
527	Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres
528	Our evolving dynamic planet has survived[…] mass extinctions
530	South Australia is winning: it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity.
531	When South Australians buy electricity at $14,200/MWh, they are paying the equivalent of $400 a litre for petrol.
532	Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save.
534	Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state
538	Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25°C, forest dieback will add 0.11°C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9°C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02°C.
539	We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said.
540	The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming
548	The jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems.
549	The extent of climate change’s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research.
550	Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit.
551	Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate.
554	The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme.
555	In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.
556	The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be.
558	Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists.
559	And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.
562	current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two
564	This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.
565	In looking at Earth’s past, scientists can predict what the future will look like
567	But as the change gets larger or more persistent … it appears they underestimate climate change
568	The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.
575	While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.
576	‘Summers keep getting hotter,’ said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.
577	‘Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.

581	the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm
582	On the other side of the Atlantic ocean, climates are typically milder as a result of the cooling from the Gulf Stream.
583	But despite [the Gulf Stream], the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.
586	The sun was so intense, it took the mercury up to in excess of 120°F as it topped out at 122.4 °F (50.2°C).
590	Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees.
591	But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.
593	It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees.
598	If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised.
603	Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today
609	That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”
614	The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery.
615	If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier, as scientists anticipate, year-to-year recovery will become more difficult.
616	The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times
619	Last year, though, was a wet one on the Rio Grande, with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016-17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs.
620	Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.
621	Dr. Gutzler said spring temperatures have an impact, too, with warmer air causing more snow to turn to vapor and essentially disappear.
622	A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.
623	The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”
625	I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.
626	The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.
628	as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted
630	I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice.
633	Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2.
634	But there is also good data showing sea levels
637	By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so—a far cry from Al Gore’s alarming numbers
638	Mr. Singer is a professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia.
642	Some experts think we’re on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which would cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius
644	an individual heatwave triggering coral bleaching cannot be linked to global warming as the process triggering an individual heatwave is fundamentally different from that triggering global warming
645	Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen
646	If Houlton’s finding about these vast, previously unknown nitrogen stores holds true, then it would have an enormous impact on global warming predictions.
648	‘there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.’
649	“Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years.
656	The Arctic’s carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought […] methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming
661	“Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen.
662	Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”
663	“For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet.
665	many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing
666	while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.
667	The failure of the 2007 polar bear survival model is a simple fact that explodes the myth that polar bears are on their way to extinction.
668	Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.
669	Sea level rise of 65 centimeters, or roughly 2 feet would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world.
676	more so than downsizing one’s car, or being vigilant about turning off light bulbs, and certainly more than quitting showering.
677	“Which is to say that these beans will be eaten by cows, and the cows will convert the beans to meat, and the humans will eat the meat.
678	In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.”
687	When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly.
688	“The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,’ said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
689	The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean.
692	“We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high,” Christy said in a statement.
695	Models are too sensitive to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, he said.
696	climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere
697	While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations, few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves.
698	A recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot, the ‘overestimation’ was ‘partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.’
699	While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend
701	“‘Those eruptions happened relatively early in our study period, which pushed down temperatures in the first part of the dataset, which caused the overall record to show an exaggerated warming trend,’ Christy said.
702	‘While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend.
703	If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset, they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers, or a long-term cooling,’ Christy said.”
705	policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered
708	Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance
710	With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago
712	“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings.
716	Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.
717	Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates
721	“‘If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,’ says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.
724	A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries.
728	The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate”
736	But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.
737	The new research showed that [oxygen isotopes in foraminifera] can change
739	The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells isn’t a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway.
740	“To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long.
741	For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time”
742	Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.
745	The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”
749	“The worldwide temperature record has been changed.
752	[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.
755	[Those who signed the Paris Accord] cannot change Earth’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate
756	Australia’s signed a suicide note [with the Paris Accord] yet didn’t seem to notice that China, India, Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions.
757	The grasslands, crops, forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits.
761	[Riebesell] is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification.
762	‘But even if an organism isn’t directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web.’
763	And some plants – like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis – may even benefit.
764	[…]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change.
765	The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.”
768	“We’ve known about [the greenhouse effect] for more than a century.
770	[CO2] has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far
772	Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.
774	The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.
775	Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.
776	Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm
784	“Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense.
785	In many other cases, though — hurricanes, for example — the linkage to global warming for particular trends is uncertain or disputed.
787	The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.
788	But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.
789	Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.
791	‘Clean coal’ is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.
797	Climate Models Have Overestimated Global Warming
799	the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’
800	The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the ‘slowdown’ in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 ‘emissions budget’ for the coming decades.
802	that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was ‘generally smaller than trends estimated’ from the models.”
803	The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming ‘hiatus’ in the beginning of the 21st century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases…
805	The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts.
806	Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.”
807	the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.
809	In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible.
811	But [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.
812	The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm
814	Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet
815	Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation.
816	While geologists have studied events in the past similar to what appears to be happening today, scientists are largely unsure of what lies ahead.
817	Scientists have long known about the anomalous ‘warming hole‘ in the North Atlantic Ocean, an area immune to warming of Earth’s oceans.
818	“Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health.
819	Climate change need not endanger anyone”
820	“Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow, widely predicted, relatively small economic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis.
821	Societies do fall apart from war, disease or chaos.
822	Climate policy must compete with other long-term threats for always-scarce resources.”
823	’Extremely remarkable’ 2017 heads toward record for hottest year without an El Niño episode.
824	So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago.
826	The latest NOAA report is “a reminder that climate change has not, despite the insistence of climate contrarians ‘paused’ or even slowed down,” Mann said..
828	Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreak — sooner than you think.
830	parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable
832	Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as ‘calving.’
839	“Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015.
840	At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer.
846	In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.
847	“The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere).
849	The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.”
851	The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.
855	Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.”
856	as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity.
859	By 2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever was.
861	None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any.
862	In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago.
863	The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected.
864	“[Carbon dioxide] just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100.
868	In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million”
871	“As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation.

889	“Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity.
892	Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.
893	While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.
896	According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.
897	The report […] found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.”
901	CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic.
903	Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”
904	Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.
905	“Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity.
906	Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere ‘is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”
909	Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs.
910	The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.”
914	The Clean Power Plan, a major component of fulfilling the agreement, would spike energy costs for working and middle-class Texans by 16% by 2030, according to the Economic Reliability Council of Texas
916	The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.
917	Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate.
919	an airplane is contributing to the emissions that put the frozen continent at risk.
920	If those emissions continue unchecked and the world is allowed to heat up enough, scientists have no doubt that large parts of Antarctica will melt into the sea.
925	About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.
926	The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.”
930	“Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea.
932	The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer.
935	The winds around the continent seem to be strengthening, stirring the ocean and bringing up a layer of warmer water that has most likely been there for centuries.
938	We’re not sure because we don’t have enough data, for long enough, to separate signal from noise,” said Eric J. Steig, a scientist at the University of Washington who has studied temperature trends in Antarctica.
939	“Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century.
942	‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
945	In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century.
948	In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals.
949	Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.”
952	The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule, a new study finds
954	Melting permafrost can release not just CO2, but also methane, a much stronger heat-trapping gas.
956	Data from NOAA’s Barrow Alaska station ‘indicate that October through December emissions of CO2 from surrounding tundra increased by 73 percent since 1975, supporting the view that rising temperatures have made Arctic ecosystems a net source of CO2.’”
957	ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C
960	This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years
962	In April the extent of Arctic sea ice was back to where it was in April 13 years ago
967	He said: ‘We have had five warming cycles since about 900AD, each followed by a dramatic cooling cycle.’
971	Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.
972	“Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.
976	The gas builds up in the soil, forming mounds called ‘pingoes.’
978	The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.
979	“Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation.
982	Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.
983	‘The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter,’ said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
988	The unlikely scenarios are now, all of a sudden, becoming more probable than they once were thought to be,’ says Sweet.”
990	many of south Florida’s drainage systems and seawalls are no longer enough
991	“Sea level rise is global.
993	While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”
994	says Sweet, who has authored several sea-level rise studies.
995	“The Northern Hemisphere jet stream […] flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large.
996	But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does […] the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated.
997	Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes
1001	‘This study goes beyond statistical correlations and explores a specific process that can plausibly explain how enhanced high-latitude warming trends may trigger remote weather impacts,’ he said.
1003	A recent study in Nature Geoscience, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.”
1007	‘With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,’ said Taalas.
1009	‘Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months’
1010	“‘The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us.
1011	The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.’”
1013	Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm.
1014	Final data for 2016 sea level rise have yet to be published.
1017	Our children and grandchildren will look back on the climate deniers and ask how they could have sacrificed the planet for the sake of cheap fossil fuel energy, when the cost of inaction exceeds the cost of a transition to a low-carbon economy,’ Watson said.
1019	An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880.
1020	“The global reef crisis does not necessarily mean extinction for coral species.
1021	The corals may save themselves, as many other creatures are attempting to do, by moving toward the poles as the Earth warms, establishing new reefs in cooler water.”
1022	If water temperatures stay moderate, the damaged sections of the Great Barrier Reef may be covered with corals again in as few as 10 or 15 years
1023	Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.
1024	“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases.
1028	A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”
1034	Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 —
1038	(Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.)”
1040	While evidence that the earth’s orbital variations impact radiation levels and thus global temperatures does not of course mean that man is not in some way impacting the climate, studies like these highlight that the role man plays on the planet is dwarfed by natural phenomena utterly out of our control.
1048	While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.
1049	So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows.
1050	In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.
1052	But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.
1055	They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline.’”
1056	Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others.
1057	“Moreover, the ocean already contains so-called oxygen minimum zones, generally found in the middle depths.
1061	warmer oceans have also begun to destabilize glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica
1065	However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods.
1066	[…] in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.
1067	“In an old climate, … extremely warm years were less common and snowpack was more reliable …
1069	“There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record.
1073	The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
1075	“At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said.
1077	Antarctic ice fluctuates wildly year to year, and the link to man-made global warming there is not clear, NASA ice expert Walt Meier said.
1078	“[Sea ice] also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean.
1079	“ NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet’s land and oceans, and expressing ‘greater than 95 percent certainty’ in that conclusion.
1082	“But the differences between NOAA and NASA aren’t that significant, Schmidt further argued, in the context of the bigger picture.
1083	‘Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting, and there’s lots of technical work that can be done there, but the main take-home response there is that the trends we’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way,’ he said.”
1084	[Jonathan Overpeck:] ‘No doubt about it anymore — humans, mainly by burning fossil fuels, are cooking the planet,’ Overpeck said.
1087	The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way, Overpeck said, noting that the stratosphere… saw record cold temperatures last year
1088	‘We don’t expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear.’”
1089	Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.
1090	Extreme high temperatures were seen from India — where the city of Phalodi recorded temperatures of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit) in May, a new national record — to Iran, where a temperature of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 F) was recorded in Delhoran on July 22.
1092	But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH
1093	Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath.
1097	“[…]The impact on calcification, metabolism, growth, fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units […] is beneficial, not damaging.
1098	Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification.”
1103	[ocean acidification was ] First referenced in a peer-reviewed study in Nature in 2003
1108	There was, he said, an ‘inherent bias’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘doom and gloom stories’.
1109	“The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt.
1112	“The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker.
1113	This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.”
1115	This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold.”
1116	Severe ‘snowmageddon’ winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked.
1119	Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: ‘The consensus points towards that being a real effect.’”
1120	The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.
1121	Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.
1127	This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.
1130	The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’”
1133	Global average temperatures over land have plummeted by more than 1C since the middle of this year – their biggest and steepest fall on record.
1135	Scientists confirm a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef this year has killed more corals than ever before, with more than two thirds destroyed across large swathes of the biodiverse site.
1136	When water temperatures become too high, coral becomes stressed and expels the algae, which leave the coral a bleached white color.
1138	Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.
1139	Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.
1141	“While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic.
1142	Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.”
1143	Skeptics have long pointed to ice gain in the Southern Hemisphere as evidence climate change wasn’t occurring, but scientists warned that it was caused by natural variations and circulations in the atmosphere.
1144	It “certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica’s ice is just going up and up,” Meier said.
1145	For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.
1146	“It’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic, and now the Antarctic, is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice.
1149	Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently, and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why.
1150	To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice.
1151	“Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas.
1154	[CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.
1155	But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)
1156	The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.
1157	“In 2013 the level of U.S. farm output was about 2.7 times its 1948 level, and productivity was growing at an average annual rate of 1.52%.
1160	With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge [feeding 2.5 billion more people] can and will be met.
1163	“Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime.
1164	Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change.”
1166	Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past.
1167	Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past.
1169	“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years.
1170	If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”
1171	If Hillary would have fact-checked her example of sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia, she would have found out that the experts already know this is mostly due to the land there sinking.
1173	[…]until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements.
1175	But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.
1178	“The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area.
1180	“It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area.
1181	However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass.

1202	The discrepancy between model-predicted warming and (lower) real-world observations has inspired new respect for natural climate variability relative to greenhouse-gas forcing.
1204	Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire counties away.

1216	…obsessing about climate change is avoiding a frank discussion about the here-and-now problems of budget deficits, the federal debt, school choice, entitlement reform, and so on.
1219	Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.”
1222	The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.
1223	Ice cap is disappearing far more rapidly than previously estimated, and is part of a long-term trend, new research shows
1224	“Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years.
1227	These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep, but they can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars, kill lawns and forests, and poison wells with salt.
1230	On the Pacific Coast, a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending, so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California.
1235	“During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earth’s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land.

1259	While the north-east, midwest and upper great plains have experienced a 30% increase in heavy rainfall episodes – considered once-in-every-five year downpours – parts of the west, particularly California, have been parched by drought.
1260	The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.
1265	Some, however, bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred, they should not be linked to climate change”
1266	This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times

1273	The rapid changes in the climate may have profound consequences for humans and other species… Severe drought caused food shortages for millions of people in Ethiopia, with a lack of rainfall resulting in “intense and widespread” forest fires in Indonesia that belched out a vast quantity of greenhouse gas
1276	“Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models.
1279	“Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions.
1284	It is clear, then, that greening is emerging as a factor with the potential to blunt some of the worst impacts of human greenhouse gas emissions.
1286	Arctic greening was recently cited, in a major report by the U.S. Geological Survey, as the central reason that the state of Alaska, despite worsening wildfires and more thaw of permafrost, might still be able to stow away more carbon than it loses over the course of the 21st century.”
1292	Any reasonable person can recognize both positives and negatives among the policy proposals of both Tories and Labour.
1293	Over time, climate becomes a net problem: by the 2070s, the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP.
1294	“Because CO₂ acts as a fertilizer, as much as half of all vegetated land is persistently greener today.
1296	precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener
1299	A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP, because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience.

1307	a new study by scientists at the Australian Research Council finds that the ongoing bleaching event is mainly due to human-caused global warming, and that if global warming proceeds as currently expected, “large parts” of the Great Barrier Reef could die by the mid-2030s.

2189	This makes it clear that this time around humans are the cause, mainly by our CO2 emissions.
2192	The data suggests solar activity is influencing the global climate causing the world to get warmer."
2193	In the last 35 years of global warming, the sun has shown a slight cooling trend.
2199	The consequences of climate change become increasingly bad after each additional degree of warming, with the consequences of 2°C being quite damaging and the consequences of 4°C being potentially catastrophic.
2200	The Petition Project features over 31,000 scientists signing the petition stating "There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will, in the forseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere ...".
2201	That humans are causing global warming is the position of the Academies of Science from 80 countries plus many scientific organizations that study climate science.
2202	More specifically, around 95% of active climate researchers actively publishing climate papers endorse the consensus position.
2204	All the indicators show that global warming is still happening.
2205	"In fact global warming has stopped and a cooling is beginning.
2206	No climate model has predicted a cooling of the Earth – quite the  contrary.
2208	Empirical measurements of the Earth's heat content show the planet is still accumulating heat and global warming is still happening.
2209	Surface temperatures can show short-term cooling when heat is exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean, which has a much greater heat capacity than the air.
2210	"[Models] are full of fudge factors that are fitted to the existing climate, so the models more or less agree with the observed data.
2212	While there are uncertainties with climate models, they successfully reproduce the past and have made predictions that have been subsequently confirmed by observations.
2213	The warming trend is the same in rural and urban areas, measured by thermometers and satellites, and by natural thermometers.
2214	"We found [U.S. weather] stations located next to  the exhaust fans of air conditioning units, surrounded by asphalt  parking lots and roads, on blistering-hot rooftops, and near sidewalks  and buildings that absorb and radiate heat.
2215	We found 68 stations located  at wastewater treatment plants, where the process of waste digestion  causes temperatures to be higher than in surrounding areas.
2217	Numerous studies into the effect of urban heat island effect and microsite influences find they have negligible effect on long-term trends, particularly when averaged over large regions.
2219	The increase in temperatures since 1975 is a consistent feature of all reconstructions.
2221	Natural temperature measurements also confirm the general accuracy of the instrumental temperature record.
2222	A large number of ancient mass extinction events have been strongly linked to global climate change.
2223	Because current climate change is so rapid, the way species typically adapt (eg - migration) is, in most cases, simply not be possible.
2227	Every part of the Earth's climate system has continued warming since 1998, with 2015 shattering temperature records.
2229	but Antarctica is losing land ice at an accelerating rate, which has implications for sea level rise.
2230	[Ice] is expanding in much of Antarctica, contrary to the widespread public belief that global warming is melting the continental ice cap.
2236	The majority of peer reviewed research at the time predicted warming due to increasing CO2.
2238	"An article in Science magazine illustrated that a rise in carbon dioxide did not precede a rise in temperatures, but actually lagged behind temperature rises by 200 to 1000 years.
2241	When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit.
2242	The warming causes the oceans to release CO2.
2243	The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet.
2244	So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise.
2245	Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.
2246	"His [Dr Spencer's] latest research demonstrates that – in the short term, at any rate –  the temperature feedbacks that the IPCC imagines will greatly amplify  any initial warming caused by CO2 are net-negative, attenuating the  warming they are supposed to enhance.
2247	His best estimate is that the  warming in response to a doubling of CO2 concentration, which may happen  this century unless the usual suspects get away with shutting down the  economies of the West, will be a harmless 1 Fahrenheit degree, not the 6  F predicted by the IPCC."
2248	Climate sensitivity can be calculated empirically by comparing past temperature change to natural forcings at the time.
2250	Some global warming 'skeptics' argue that the Earth's climate sensitivity is so low that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will result in a surface temperature change on the order of 1°C or less, and that therefore global warming is nothing to worry about.
2255	And  since the last ice age ended almost exactly 11,500 years ago…" (Ice Age Now)
2256	The warming effect from more CO2 greatly outstrips the influence from changes in the Earth's orbit or solar activity, even if solar levels were to drop to Maunder Minimum levels.
2257	'Our harmless emissions of trifling quantities of carbon dioxide cannot possibly acidify the oceans.
2260	The current debate on the connection between CO2 emissions and climate change has largely overlooked an independent and equally serious problem, the increasing acidity of our oceans.
2261	Last December, the respected  journal “Oceanography” published projections (see graphic below) for this rising acidity, measured by falling pH
2262	Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores.
2263	They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.
2266	A number of independent investigations from different countries, universities and government bodies have investigated the stolen emails and found no evidence of wrong doing.
2267	Focusing on a few suggestive emails, taken out of context, merely serves to distract from the wealth of empirical evidence for man-made global warming.
2268	“[T]he 1079 emails and 72 documents seem indeed evidence of a scandal  involving most of the most prominent scientists pushing the man-made  warming theory - a scandal that is one of the greatest in modern  science.
2272	It found the scientists' rigour and honesty are not in doubt, and their behaviour did not prejudice the IPCC's conclusions, though they did fail to display the proper degree of openness.
2275	[…] Constant 24-7  media coverage of every significant storm worldwide just makes it seem  that way.”
2276	It is unclear whether global warming is increasing hurricane frequency but there is increasing evidence that warming increases hurricane intensity.
2277	Al Gore's film was "broadly accurate" according to an expert witness called when an attempt was made through the courts to prevent the film being shown in schools.
2280	While there are minor errors in An Inconvenient Truth, the main truths presented - evidence to show mankind is causing global warming and its various impacts is consistent with peer reviewed science.
2282	While there are isolated cases of growing glaciers, the overwhelming trend in glaciers worldwide is retreat.
2283	In fact, the global melt rate has been accelerating since the mid-1970s.
2284	Cosmic ray counts have increased over the past 50 years, so if they do influence global temperatures, they are having a cooling effect.
2286	By regulating the Earth’s cloud cover, the Sun  can turn the temperature up and down. ...
2288	While the link between cosmic rays and cloud cover is yet to be confirmed, more importantly, there has been no correlation between cosmic rays and global temperatures over the last 30 years of global warming.
2289	In fact, in recent years when cosmic rays should have been having their largest cooling effect on record, temperatures have been at their highest on record.
2290	Hypothetically, an increasing solar magnetic field could deflect galactic cosmic rays, which hypothetically seed low-level clouds, thus decreasing the Earth's reflectivity and causing global warming.
2293	Steve McIntyre noticed a strange  discontinuity in US temperature data, occurring around January 2000.
2295	As a result, "The warmest  year on US record is now 1934.
2298	(2012 is now the hottest by a wide margin), but the USA only comprises 2% of the globe.
2300	"Austria is today seeing its earliest snowfall in history with 30 to 40 centimetres already predicted in the mountains.
2302	Since the mid 1970s, global temperatures have been warming at around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade.
2303	However, weather imposes its own dramatic ups and downs over the long term trend.
2304	We expect to see record cold temperatures even during global warming.
2305	Nevertheless over the last decade, daily record high temperatures occurred twice as often as record lows.

2312	Everybody knows that the Pacific island of Tuvalu is sinking. ...
2313	Around 1990 it became obvious the local tide-gauge did not agree - there was no evidence of 'sinking.'
2317	What they find is sea level rise has been steadily accelerating over the past century.
2318	A paper by Ross McKitrick, an economics professor at the  University of Guelph, and Patrick Michaels, an environmental studies  professor at the University of Virginia, concludes that half of the  global warming trend from 1980 to 2002 is caused by Urban Heat Island.
2319	While urban areas are undoubtedly warmer than surrounding rural areas, this has had little to no impact on warming trends.
2320	While the Medieval Warm Period saw unusually warm temperatures in some regions, globally the planet was cooler than current conditions.
2323	Now scientists are telling us that Mars is experiencing its own planetary warming: Martian warming.
2325	Martian climate is primarily driven by dust and albedo and there is little empirical evidence that Mars is showing long term warming.
2326	"In 2007, the Northern Hemisphere reached a record low in ice coverage and the Northwest Passage was opened.
2328	What you were not told was that the data that triggered this record is only available back to the late 1970s.
2329	We know the Northwest Passage had been open before."
2330	Arctic sea ice has been retreating over the past 30 years.
2333	"While major green house gas  H2O substantially warms the Earth, minor green house gases such as CO2  have little effect....
2335	Satellite measurements of infrared spectra over the past 40 years observe less energy escaping to space at the wavelengths associated with CO2.
2336	Surface measurements find more downward infrared radiation warming the planet's surface.
2337	This provides a direct, empirical causal link between CO2 and global warming.
2338	The amount of warming caused by the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 may be one of the most misunderstood subjects in climate science.
2344	Early estimates of ocean heat from the Argo showed a cooling bias due to pressure sensor issues.
2347	In truth, the overwhelming majority of climate-research funding comes from the federal government and left-wing foundations.
2358	The CO2 that nature emits (from the ocean and vegetation) is balanced by natural absorptions (again by the ocean and vegetation).
2359	Therefore human emissions upset the natural balance, rising CO2 to levels not seen in at least 800,000 years.
2360	In fact, human emit 26 gigatonnes of CO2 per year while CO2 in the atmosphere is rising by only 15 gigatonnes per year - much of human CO2 emissions is being absorbed by natural sinks.
2361	"Unquestionably, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed to build the scientific case for humanity being the primary cause of global warming.
2363	The IPCC lead authors are experts in their field, instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.
2365	Comparisons to the most recent data consistently finds that climate change is occurring more rapidly and intensely than indicated by IPCC predictions.
2366	Increased CO2 makes more water vapor, a greenhouse gas which amplifies warming
2369	The public understand it, in that if  you get a fall evening or spring evening and the sky is clear the heat  will escape and the temperature will drop and you get frost.
2370	If there is  a cloud cover, the heat is trapped by water vapour as a greenhouse gas  and the temperature stays quite warm.
2374	Water vapour is the most dominant greenhouse gas.
2377	“A leading Canadian authority on polar bears, Mitch Taylor, said: ‘We’re  seeing an increase in bears that’s really unprecedented, and in places  where we’re seeing a decrease in the population
2378	The costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of mitigation.
2381	Economic assessments of proposed policy to put a price on carbon emissions are in widespread agreement that the net economic impact will be minor.
2384	Climate economics research shows that in reality, we are harming the economy by failing to implement CO2 limits.
2387	The Greenland ice sheet is at least 400,000 years old and warming was not global when Europeans settled in Greeland 1,000 years ago
2390	There may have been regions of Greenland that were 'greener' than today
2391	Greenland on the whole is losing ice, as confirmed by multiple satellite and on the ground field measurements.
2394	(2005), where satellite altimetry  established that the mean thickness of the entire Greenland ice sheet  had increased at 2 inches per year – a total of almost 2 feet – in the  11 years 1993-2003.”
2395	While the Greenland interior is in mass balance, the coastlines are losing ice.
2396	Overall Greenland is losing ice mass at an accelerating rate.
2398	While there are direct ways in which CO2 is a pollutant (acidification of the ocean), its primary impact is its greenhouse warming effect.
2399	While the greenhouse effect is a natural occurence, too much warming has severe negative impacts on agriculture, health and environment.
2400	'To suddenly label CO2 as a "pollutant" is a disservice to a gas that has played an enormous role in the development and sustainability of all life on this wonderful Earth.
2401	Mother Earth has clearly ruled that CO2 is not a pollutant.'
2402	Although it has some very important and beneficial effects, CO2 meets the legal and encyclopedic definitions of a "pollutant", and human CO2 emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare.
2406	This growth stimulation occurs because CO2 is one of the two raw materials (the other being water) that are required for photosynthesis.
2409	Less energy is escaping to space: Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts like a blanket; adding more CO2 makes the 'blanket' thicker, and humans are adding more CO2 all the time.
2410	"There is no actual evidence that carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming.
2411	Note that computer models are just concatenations of calculations you could do on a hand-held calculator, so they are theoretical and cannot be part of any evidence."
2413	Satellite and surface measurements find less energy is escaping to space at CO2 absorption wavelengths.
2414	Ocean and surface temperature measurements find the planet continues to accumulate heat.
2417	Mars, Triton, Pluto and Jupiter all show global warming, pointing to the Sun as the dominating influence in determining climate throughout the solar system."
2420	The sun has shown no long term trend since 1950 and in fact has shown a slight cooling trend in recent decades.
2422	As of today,JAXA shows that we have more ice than any time on this date for the past 8 years of Aqua satellite measurement for this AMSRE dataset."
2423	Arctic sea ice has been steadily thinning, even in the last few years while the surface ice (eg - sea ice extent) increased slightly.
2424	Consequently, the total amount of Arctic sea ice in 2008 and 2009 are the lowest on record.
2426	"Twentieth century global warming did not start until  1910.
2427	By that time CO2 emissions had already risen from the expanded use  of coal that had powered the industrial revolution, and emissions only  increased slowly from 3.5gigatonnes in 1910 to under 4gigatonnes by the  end of the Second World War.
2428	It was the post war  industrialization that caused the rapid rise in global CO2 emissions,  but by 1945 when this began, the Earth was already in a cooling phase  that started around 1942 and continued until 1975.
2429	With 32 years of  rapidly increasing global temperatures and only a minor increase in  global CO2 emissions, followed by 33 years of slowly cooling global  temperatures with rapid increases in global CO2 emissions, it was  deceitful for the IPCC to make any claim that CO2 emissions were  primarily responsible for observed 20th century global warming."
2430	Even during a period of long term warming, there are short periods of cooling due to climate variability.
2431	Short term cooling over the last few years is largely due to a strong La Nina phase in the Pacific Ocean and a prolonged solar minimum.
2432	The sun was warming up then, but the sun hasn’t been warming since 1970.
2434	The IPCC blames human emissions of carbon dioxide for the last  warming.
2438	Greenhouse gases have been the main contributor of warming since 1970.
2441	Furthermore, it is physically incorrect to state that the planet is simply "recovering" from the Little Ice Age.
2444	There are a number of forcings which affect climate (eg - stratospheric aerosols, solar variations).
2445	When all forcings are combined, they show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.
2447	The main reason behind this mid-century cooling was global dimming due to anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions.
2449	"January 2008 capped a 12 month period of global temperature drops on all of the major well respected indicators.
2453	"The killer proof that CO2 does not drive climate is to be found during the Ordovician- Silurian and the Jurassic-Cretaceous periods when CO2 levels were greater than 4000 ppmv (parts per million by volume) and about 2000 ppmv respectively.
2455	When CO2 levels were higher in the past, solar levels were also lower.
2457	"Of the rise in temperature during the 20th century, the bulk occurred from 1900 to 1940.
2460	That drop in temperature came after what was described in the National Geographic as 'six decades of abnormal warmth'."
2461	Early 20th century warming was in large part due to rising solar activity and relatively quiet volcanic activity.
2463	Volcanoes have been relatively frequent and if anything, have exerted a cooling effect.
2464	While natural forcings can account for much of the early 20th Century warming, humans played a role as well.
2468	"Satellite measurements indicate an absence of significant global warming since 1979, the very period that human carbon dioxide emissions have been increasing rapidly.
2474	Warming trends agree well with surface temperatures and model predictions except near the Poles.
2476	The global dimming trend reversed around 1990 - 15 years after the global warming trend began in the mid 1970's.
2478	(Kerr 2007) points out that the sunlight-reflecting haze that cools much of the planet seems to have thinned over the past decade or so.
2482	The warm and cool regions roughly balance each other out with little impact on global temperature.
2483	"Britain's big freeze is the start of a worldwide trend towards colder weather that seriously challenges global warming theories, eminent scientists claimed yesterday.
2484	The world has entered a 'cold mode' which is likely to bring a global dip in temperatures which will last for 20 to 30 years, they say.
2485	A natural cycle requires a forcing, and no known forcing exists that fits the fingerprints of observed warming - except anthropogenic greenhouse gases.
2486	The minute increase of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere (0.008%) was not the cause of the warming—it was a continuation of natural cycles that occurred over the past 500 years."
2487	The El Nino Southern Oscillation shows close correlation to global temperatures over the short term.
2488	However, it is unable to explain the long term warming trend over the past few decades.
2489	"Three Australasian researchers have shown that natural forces are the dominant influence on climate, in a study just published in the highly-regarded Journal of Geophysical Research.
2493	Mount Kilimanjaro's shrinking glacier is complicated and not due to just global warming.
2494	There is ample evidence that Earth's average temperature has increased in the past 100 years and the decline of mid- and high-latitude glaciers is a major piece of evidence.
2495	'Gore claims the snowcap atop Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro is shrinking and that global warming is to blame.
2497	Without the forests' humidity, previously moisture-laden winds blew dry.
2499	First, they concur with the believers that the Earth has been warming since the end of a Little Ice Age around 1850.
2500	Believers think the warming is man-made, while the skeptics believe the warming is natural and contributions from man are minimal and certainly not potentially catastrophic à la Al Gore.'
2501	The human fingerprint in global warming is evident in multiple lines of empirical evidence - in satellite measurements of outgoing infrared radiation, in surface measurements of downward infrared radiation, in the cooling stratosphere and other metrics.
2502	Fundamental physics and global climate models both make testable predictions as to how the global climate should change in response to anthropogenic warming.
2506	The IPCC confirms that computer modeling predicts the existence of a tropical, mid-troposphere “hot spot” about 10km above the Earth’s surface.
2508	"The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is a temperature pattern in the Pacific Ocean that spends roughly 20-30 years in the cool phase or the warm phase.
2509	In 1905, PDO switched to a warm phase.
2510	In 1946, PDO switched to a cool phase.
2511	In 1977, PDO switched to a warm phase.
2515	When the PDO last switched to a cool phase, global temperatures were about 0.4C cooler than currently.
2516	The long term warming trend indicates the total energy in the Earth's climate system is increasing due to an energy imbalance.
2520	According to the second law of  thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist."
2521	The atmosphere of the Earth is less able to absorb shortwave radiation from the Sun than thermal radiation coming from the surface.
2522	The effect of this disparity is that thermal radiation escaping to space comes mostly from the cold upper atmosphere, while the surface is maintained at a substantially warmer temperature.
2523	This is called the "atmospheric greenhouse effect", and without it the Earth's surface would be much colder.
2530	Glaciers are in rapid retreat worldwide, despite 1 error in 1 paragraph in a 3000 page IPCC report.
2531	"In 1999 New Scientist reported a comment by the leading Indian glaciologist Syed Hasnain, who said in an email interview with this author that all the glaciers in the central and eastern Himalayas could disappear by 2035.
2536	But the central message of the IPCC AR4, is confirmed by the peer reviewed literature.
2538	Satellites and on-site measurements are observing that Himalayan glaciers are disappearing at an accelerating rate.
2539	"[T]he influence of  so-called greenhouse gases on near-surface temperature - is not yet  absolutely proven.
2540	In other words, there is as yet no incontrovertible  proof either of the greenhouse effect, or its connection with alleged  global warming.
2542	The statement that so-called greenhouse gases,  especially CO2, contribute to near-surface atmospheric warming is in  glaring contradiction to well-known physical laws relating to gas and  vapour, as well as to general caloric theory.'
2547	The modelers confused cause and effect, thereby getting the feedback in the wrong direction."
2549	"Many people think the science of climate change is settled.
2552	The geologic record provides us with abundant evidence for such perpetual natural climate variability, from icecaps reaching almost to the equator to none at all, even at the poles.
2553	The climate debate is, in reality, about a 1.6 watts per square metre or 0.5 per cent discrepancy in the poorly known planetary energy balance."
2555	Different areas of science are understood with varying degrees of certainty.
2556	For example, we have a lower understanding of the effect of aerosols while we have a high understanding of the warming effect of carbon dioxide.
2557	Poorly understood aspects of climate change do not change the fact that a great deal of climate science is well understood.
2560	In the 11,400 years since the end of the last Ice Age, sea  level has risen at an average of 4 feet/century, though it is now rising  much more slowly because very nearly all of the land-based ice that is  at low enough latitudes and altitudes to melt has long since gone."
2561	Observed sea levels are actually tracking at the upper range of the IPCC projections.
2562	When accelerating ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica are factored into sea level projections, the estimated sea level rise by 2100 is between 75cm to 2 metres.
2564	This small warming is  likely a result of the natural alterations in global ocean currents  which are driven by ocean salinity variations.
2565	Human kind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes.
2568	"The IPCC also made false predictions on the Amazon rain forests, referenced to a non peer-reviewed paper produced by an advocacy group working with the WWF.
2570	The IPCC statement on Amazon rain forests is correct.
2571	The error was incorrect citation, failing to mention the peer-reviewed papers where the data came from.
2574	On a world scale coral reefs are in decline.
2575	Over the last 30-40 years 80% of coral in the Caribbean have been destroyed and 50% in Indonesia and the Pacific.
2577	"Three recent articles give us reason to question the alarmists’ claims  that coral reefs are in deep trouble due to the buildup of greenhouse  gases." (World Climate Report)
2579	Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere.
2580	Volcanoes emit around 0.3 billion tonnes of CO2 per year.
2583	"Each unit of CO2 you put into the atmosphere has less and less of a warming impact.
2584	Once the atmosphere reaches a saturation point, additional input of CO2 will not really have any major impact.
2587	If the CO2 effect was saturated, adding more CO2 should add no additional greenhouse effect.
2588	However, satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at the wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy.
2590	This argument originates from Angstrom's work in 1901.
2591	We now know that the planetary energy balance is determined by the upper levels of the troposphere and that the saturation of the absorption at the central frequency does not preclude the possibility to absorb more energy.
2592	"A July 6, 2007 study published in the journal Science about Greenland by an international team of scientists found DNA “evidence that suggests the frozen shield covering the immense island survived the Earth’s last period of global warming,” according to a Boston Globe Article.  ...
2593	[T]he study indicates “Greenland’s ice may be less susceptible to the massive meltdown predicted by computer models of climate change, the main author ... said in an interview. ...
2599	Small amounts of very active substances can cause large effects.
2600	"We have been grossly misled to think there is tens of thousands of times as much CO2 as there is!
2602	If the public were aware that man-made CO2 is so incredibly small there would be very little belief in a climate disaster ..."
2603	While methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, there is over 200 times more CO2 in the atmosphere.
2605	"A United Nations report has identified the world's  rapidly growing herds of cattle as the greatest threat to the climate,  forests and wildlife. ...
2606	...Livestock are responsible for 18 per cent of the  greenhouse gases that cause global warming, more than cars, planes and  all other forms of transport put together.
2607	Burning fuel to produce fertiliser to grow feed, to  produce meat and to transport it - and clearing vegetation for grazing -  produces 9 per cent of all emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common  greenhouse gas.
2608	And their wind and manure emit more than one third of  emissions of another, methane, which warms the world 20 times faster  than carbon dioxide.
2609	Individual carbon dioxide molecules have a short life time of around 5 years in the atmosphere.
2611	The final amount of extra CO2 that remains in the atmosphere stays there on a time scale of centuries.
2612	[T]he overwhelming majority of peer-reviewed studies  [find] that CO2 in the atmosphere remained there a short time.
2613	CO2 levels are measured by hundreds of stations scattered across 66 countries which all report the same rising trend.
2614	"The Keeling curve, which is widely used to show the increase in CO2 emissions, is based on data from the top of Mount Mauna Loa in Hawaii.
2616	To claim that humidity is decreasing requires you ignore a multitude of independent reanalyses that all show increasing humidity.
2618	It fails to explain how we can have short-term positive feedback and long-term negative feedback.
2620	"...the largest of all the positive or temperature-amplifying feedbacks in  the UN’s arsenal is the water-vapor feedback.
2623	(2009) have demonstrated recently  – the upper troposphere (the only place where adding CO2 to the  atmosphere could make any difference to temperature) is considerably  drier than the models are tuned to expect."
2627	Neptune's orbit is 164 years so observations (1950 to present day) span less than a third of a Neptunian year.
2630	"A new storm and a new red spot on Jupiter hints at climate change, USA TODAY and dozens of other sources explained yesterday.
2631	The temperatures are expected to change by as much as 10 Fahrenheit degrees at different places of the globe.
2632	At least close to the new spot and to the equator, nothing less than global warming is expected"
2633	Jupiter's climate change is due to shifts in internal turbulence fueled from an internal heat source - the planet radiates twice as much energy as it receives from the sun.
2641	In a paper published online this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmosphere, economics professor Ross McKitrick says the resulting discrepancies may be leading to an overstatement of the role of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
2643	The "decline" refers to a decline in northern tree-rings, not global temperature, and is openly discussed in papers and the IPCC reports.
2649	"Mike's Nature trick" has nothing to do with "hide the decline", instead refering to a technique by Michael Mann to plot instrumental temperature along with past reconstructions.
2650	The decline in tree-ring growth is openly discussed in papers and IPCC reports.
2656	The divergence of tree-ring proxies from temperatures after 1960 is openly discussed in the peer-reviewed literature and the last two IPCC assessment reports.
2657	Currently, humans are emitting around 29 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year.
2661	Current CO2 levels are the highest in 15 million years.
2662	"...there is the contention by Wolfgang Knorr of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol in England that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are about where they were 160 years ago." (as quoted by Ken Ward Jr.)
2664	Warming causes more moisture in the air which leads to more extreme precipitation events.
2666	Far from contradicting global warming, record snowfall is predicted by climate models and consistent with our expectation of more extreme precipitation events.
2668	Meanwhile, it will likely to continue to snow in Chicago in the coming days.
2671	There have long been claims that some unspecificed "they" has "changed the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change'".
2673	They changed the name from “global warming” to “climate change” after the term global warming just wasn’t working (it was too cold)!
2678	Measurements of carbon isotopes and falling oxygen in the atmosphere show that rising carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil fuels and cannot be coming from the ocean.
2679	"The solubility of carbon dioxide in water is listed in the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics as a declining function of temperature. ...
2682	The IPCC’s predicted equilibrium warming path bears no relation to the far lesser rate of “global warming” that has been observed in the 21st century to date.
2687	It seems scientists have noticed recently that quite a few planets in our solar system seem to be heating up a bit, including Pluto."
2688	Pluto's climate change over the last 14 years is likely a seasonal event.
2689	Pluto experiences drastic season changes due to an elliptical orbit (that takes 250 Earth years).
2691	There are a myriad of other radiative forcings that affect the planet's energy imbalance.
2692	Volcanoes, solar variations, clouds, methane, aerosols - these all change the way energy enters and/or leaves our climate.
2693	While there are many drivers of climate, CO2 is the most dominant radiative forcing and is increasing faster than any other forcing.
2694	The Independent Climate Change Email Review investigated the CRU scientists' actions relating to peer review.
2698	The Review concluded that CRU's actions were normal and did not threaten the integrity of peer review.
2702	While it's true that any single country's CO2 emissions reductions will make little difference, only if every nation agrees to limit CO2 emissions can we achieve significant cuts on a global scale.
2704	Australia accounts for 1.5 per cent of global carbon emissions.
2706	Monckton appears to have cherry-picked temperature data from a few stations.
2707	The full data for latitudes 64-90°N reveal the Arctic is warmer today than in 1940.
2709	When you account for the effects which are not reflected in the market price of fossil fuels, like air pollution and health impacts, the true cost of coal and other fossil fuels is higher than the cost of most renewable energy technologies.
2710	[Wind energy] is a more expensive way of producing energy than the alternative.
2711	'Antarctic sea ice set a new record in October 2007, as photographs distributed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed penguins and other cold-weather creatures able to stand farther north on Southern Hemisphere sea ice than has ever been recorded.
2712	The news of expanding Antarctic sea ice stole headlines from global warming alarmists who asserted Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest extent since 1979.'
2720	The result did suggest the sea level  was increasing in the western Pacific, but this was offset by a drop in  the level near the Alaskan coast.
2721	“Our analyses do not indicate  acceleration in sea level in U.S. tide gauge records during the 20th  century,” the study’s authors concluded.
2726	Humans are emitting 26 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.
2729	89 percent of the stations fail to meet the National Weather Service’s own siting requirements that stations must be 30 metres away from an artificial heating or radiating/reflecting heat source.
2733	A number of independent studies using near-global satellite data find positive feedback and high climate sensitivity.
2735	It appears, for the entire tropics, the observed outgoing radiation fluxes increase with the increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs).
2736	The observed behavior of radiation fluxes implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity.
2738	When you read Phil Jones' actual words, you see he's saying there is a warming trend
2741	'Phil Jones said that for the past 15 years there has been no "statistically significant" warming.
2743	"a [cloudcover] change in the Tropics could lead to a negative feedback in the global climate, with a feedback factor of about –1.1, which if correct, would more than cancel all the positive feedbacks in the more sensitive current climate models" (Lindzen et al.
2744	Dropped stations show more warming than kept stations.
2745	Two American researchers allege that U.S. government scientists have  skewed global temperature trends by ignoring readings from thousands of  local weather stations around the world, particularly those in colder  altitudes and more northerly latitudes, such as Canada.
2746	Dropped weather stations actually show a slightly warmer trend compared to kept stations.
2750	There is no way for us to prevent the world’s CO2 emissions    from doubling by 2100"
2751	The argument that solving the global warming problem by reducing human greenhouse gas emissions is "too hard" generally stems from the belief that (i) our technology is not sufficiently advanced to achieve significant emissions reductions,
2753	However, studies have determined that current technology is sufficient to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the necessary amount, and that we can do so without significant impact on the economy.
2754	"There are many urgent priorities that need the attention of Congress, and it is not for me as an invited guest in your country to say what they are.
2755	Global warming is an increasingly urgent problem.
2762	One more decade of business as usual will make this impossible.
2763	The long term trend from albedo is of cooling.
2765	"Earth’s Albedo has risen in the past few years, and by doing reconstructions of the past albedo, it appears that there was a significant reduction in Earth’s albedo leading up to a lull in 1997.
2766	The most interesting thing here is that the albedo forcings, in watts/sq meter seem to be fairly large.
2768	The long term trend from albedo is that of cooling.
2773	Tree-ring proxy reconstructions are reliable before 1960, tracking closely with the instrumental record and other independent proxies.
2774	Actual reconstructions "diverge" from the instrumental series in the last part of 20th century.
2775	For instance, in the original hockey stick (ending 1980) the last 30-40 years of data points slightly downwards.
2779	Europe and Asia  emit most of the soot from burning coal, wood, dung, and diesel in open  fires or without particulate filters in stoves, chimneys, smokestacks,  and exhaust pipes.
2780	The United States has been restricting soot emissions  in Draconian fashion since the Clean Air Act of 1963.
2782	"NASA satellite data from the years 2000 through 2011 show the Earth's atmosphere is allowing far more heat to be released into space than alarmist computer models have predicted, reports a new study in the peer-reviewed science journal Remote Sensing.
2783	The study indicates far less future global warming will occur than United Nations computer models have predicted, and supports prior studies indicating increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide trap far less heat than alarmists have claimed.
2784	A subsequent study by Dessler (2011) found that Spencer's paper was not a test of climate sensitivity or feedbacks, and his assumptions do not match empirical observational data.
2787	Hansen's 1988 results are evidence that the actual climate sensitivity is about 3°C for a doubling of atmospheric CO2.
2788	'On June 23, 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified before the House of Representatives that there was a strong "cause and effect relationship" between observed temperatures and human emissions into the atmosphere.
2789	At that time, Hansen also produced a model of the future behavior of the globe’s temperature, which he had turned into a video movie that was heavily shopped in Congress.
2790	That model predicted that global temperature between 1988 and 1997 would rise by 0.45°C (Figure 1).
2794	But his results are evidence that the actual climate sensitivity is about 3°C for a doubling of atmospheric CO2.
2796	Had he used the currently accepted value of approximately 3°C warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2, Hansen would have correctly projected the ensuing global warming.
2797	Global brightening is caused by changes in cloud cover, reflective aerosols and absorbing aerosols.
2798	While changes in cloud cover & aerosols lead to more sunlight hitting the surface, this can be compensated by the cooling effect on the atmosphere due to fewer clouds trapping less warmth and fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight.
2799	satellites confirmed measurements from ground stations show a considerable, and naturally-occurring, global brightening from 1983-2001 (Pinker et al., 2005).
2800	Elementary radiative-transfer calculations demonstrate that a natural surface global brightening amounting to ~1.9 Wm–2 over the 18-year period of study would be expected – using the IPCC’s own methodology – to have caused a transient warming of 1 K (1.8 F°).
2803	When we do the calculations and include all radiative forcings and the amount of heat being absorbed by the oceans, it shows that the Earth has warmed almost exactly as much as we would expect.
2805	Arctic sea ice loss is three times greater than Antarctic sea ice gain, and the amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth is increasing as a result.
2807	When the internal variability is removed from the temperature record, what we find is nearly monotonic, accelerating warming throughout the 20th Century.
2809	The motions of the massive oceans where heat is moved between deep layers and the surface provides variability on time scales from years to centuries.
2813	In fact, the authors go on to estimate climate sensitivity from their findings, calculate a value between 2.3 to 4.1°C.
2815	A new peer-reviewed study on Surface Warming and the Solar Cycle found that times of high solar activity are on average 0.2°C warmer than times of low solar activity, and that there is a polar amplification of the warming.
2817	The Petition Project features over 31,000 scientists signing the petition stating "there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will, in the forseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere".
2818	The 30,000 scientists and science graduates listed on the OISM petition represent a tiny fraction (0.3%) of all science graduates.
2819	More importantly, the OISM list only contains 39 scientists who specialise in climate science.
2821	The fact that so many studies on climate change don't bother to endorse the consensus position is significant because scientists have largely moved from what's causing global warming onto discussing details of the problem (eg - how fast, how soon, impacts, etc).
2822	Klaus-Martin Schulte examined all papers published from 2004 to February 2007.
2826	A drop of volcanic activity in the early 20th century may have had a warming effect.
2827	However, volcanoes have had very little impact on the last 40 years of global warming.
2834	When stomata-derived CO2 (red) is compared to ice core-derived CO2 (blue), the stomata generally show much more variability in the atmospheric CO2 level and often show levels much higher than the ice cores.
2835	Arctic summer sea ice has shrunk by an area equal to Western Australia, and might be all gone in a decade.
2836	Thanks to a rapid rebound in recent months, global sea ice levels now equal those seen 29 years ago, when the year 1979 also drew to a close.
2837	In fact, the rate of increase from September onward is the fastest rate of change on record, either upwards or downwards.
2838	The data is being reported by the University of Illinois's Arctic Climate Research Center, and is derived from satellite observations of the Northern and Southern hemisphere polar regions (Daily Tech).
2839	Ice mass loss is occuring at an accelerated rate in Greenland, Antarctica and globally from inland glaciers.
2840	Arctic sea ice is also falling at an accelerated rate.
2841	The exception to this ice loss is Antarctic sea ice which has been growing despite the warming Southern Ocean.
2843	Together, these two unaltered [sea level] datasets indicate that global mean sea level trend has remained stable over the entire period 1992-2007, altogether eliminating the apparent 3.2 mm/year rate of sea-level rise arising from the “adjusted” data.
2844	The claim sea level isn’t rising is based on blatantly doctored graphs and conspiracy theories that are contradicted by empirical observational data.
2845	The original global temperature schematic which appeared in the IPCC First Assessment Report and seemed to show the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) hotter than Present was based on the central England temperature record, and ended in the 1950s.
2849	"by the 2001 [IPCC] climate assessment...the Medieval Warm Period had been ingeniously wiped out.
2853	The Ozone Layer stops UV radiation from entering our atmosphere.
2856	At present, climate forecasts even as little as six weeks ahead can be diametrically the opposite of what actually occurs, even if the forecasts are limited to a small region of the planet.'
2857	Weather is chaotic because air is light, it has low friction and viscosity, it expands strongly when in contact with hot surfaces and it conducts heat poorly.
2862	The Independent Climate Change Email Review found the CRU scientists were unhelpful and unsympathetic to information requesters and at times broke FoI laws.
2867	Skeptics who oppose scientific findings that threaten their world view are far closer to Galileo's belief-based critics in the Catholic Church.
2868	"I mean, it - I mean - and I tell somebody, I said, just because you have a group of scientists that have stood up and said here is the fact, Galileo got outvoted for a spell" (Texas Governor Rick Perry)
2869	Claims that the IPCC does not accurately represent the views and findings of the scientists, on whose work the IPCC reports are based, are not supported by the facts.
2870	Ironically, it's those who are mispresenting Hulme's paper that are the ones being misleading.
2871	'The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on manmade global warming, according to Mike Hulme, a prominent climate scientist and IPCC insider.
2876	Science entitled The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change (Oreskes 2004).
2877	Benny Peiser conducted a search of peer-reviewed literature on the ISI Web of Science database between 1993 and 2003.
2880	For example, geothermal energy is available at all times, concentrated solar thermal energy has storage capability, and wind energy can be stored in compressed air.
2881	Numerous case studies on both regional and global scales have determined that renewable energy, if properly implemented, can provide baseload power.
2882	Trenberth's views are clarified in the paper "An imperative for climate change planning: tracking Earth's global energy".
2886	As it happens, the writer of that October 2009 e-mail—Kevin Trenberth, a lead author of the warmist bible, the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report—told Congress two years ago that evidence for manmade warming is "unequivocal.
2887	He claimed "the planet is running a ’fever’ and the prognosis is that it is apt to get much worse."
2888	But Trenberth’s "lack of warming at the moment" has been going on at least a decade.
2890	Heat is continuing to build up in the subsurface ocean.
2891	Wu et al (2010) use a new method to calculate ice sheet mass balance.
2894	"Rapid loss of ice-mass from the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica are  cited as proof positive of global warming's onslaught.
2895	The latest  measurements involve the use of satellite gravimetry, estimating  the mass of terrain beneath by detecting slight changes in gravity as a  satellite passes overhead.
2896	But gravity measurements of ice-mass loss are  complicated by glacial isostatic adjustments—compensation for the rise or fall of the underlying crustal material.
2897	A new article in Nature Geoscience  describes an innovative approach employed to derive ice-mass changes  from GRACE data.
2898	The report suggests significantly smaller overall  ice-mass losses than previous estimates.
2901	Though CRU neglected to provide an exact list of temperature stations, it could not have hid or tampered with data.
2902	"So  recently the media picked up on the fact that CRU deleted the raw data for this  important global temperature set long ago.
2903	The interesting point is that it also seems each time they come across a new  dataset it is simply replaced.
2907	Maximum warming occurs over the surface during winter while less surface warming is found in summer when heat is being used to melt sea ice.
2910	The authors seem to have jumped right  into statistical  analysis without proposing a physical mechanism that  works.
2912	temperature under the ice is fixed at -2C.  Thus elevated winter   air temperatures
2914	Whatever is driving increases in winter Arctic temperatures   is not heat coming out of the Arctic Ocean, which is covered with   insulating ice.'
2915	"Pollution; none of us are supporting putting substances into the  atmosphere or the waterways that might be pollutants, but carbon dioxide  is not a pollutant.
2916	If Senator Wong was really serious about her  science she would stop breathing because you inhale air that's got 385  parts per million carbon dioxide in it
2918	Temperature errors in the Great Lakes region are not incorporated in any of the global mean temperature records.
2920	"Global warming data apparently cooked by U.S. government-funded body  shows astounding temperature fraud with increases averaging 10 to 15  degrees Fahrenheit.
2921	The tax-payer funded National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) has become mired in fresh global warming data scandal involving  numbers for the Great Lakes region that substantially ramp up averages."
2922	Soares looks at short-term trends which are swamped by natural variations.
2924	The long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature is well established.
2927	CO2 changes are closely related to temperature.
2928	Warmer seasons or triennial phases are followed by an atmosphere that is rich in CO2, reflecting the gas solving or exsolving from water, and not photosynthesis activity.
2935	Claims have recently surfaced in the blogosphere that an increasing number of scientists are warning of an imminent global cooling, some even going so far as to call it a "growing consensus".
2939	"The climate of this planet oscillates between periods of approximately  30 years of warming followed by approximately 30 years of cooling.
2940	Rather than 100 years of unprecedented global warming as predicted by  IPCC, the global temperatures have leveled off and we seem to be heading  for cooler weather."
2942	It’s usually taken to be the fact that as carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere increase, the 1 per cent of CO2 that’s the heavier carbon isotope ratio c13 declines in proportion.
2945	But that conclusion holds true only if there are no other sources of c12 increases which are not human caused.
2948	Various independent measurements of solar activity all confirm the sun has shown a slight cooling trend since 1978.
2949	There is no single continuous satellite measurement of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI).
2951	The two most cited composites are PMOD and ACRIM.
2953	In particular, PMOD alters the data from the Nimbus7/ERB record from 1989 to 1991.
2959	Even if the warming were as big as the IPCC imagines, it would not be as dangerous as Mr. Brown suggests.
2961	Cooks ’97% consensus’ disproven by a new peer
2963	When CO2 emissions are compared directly to CO2 levels, there is a strong correlation in the long term trends.
2966	Over the three years from 1979 to 1982 when CO2 emissions were decreasing due to the rapid increase in the price of oil that drastically reduced consumption, there was no change in the rate of increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 proving that humans were not the primary source for the increase in concentration.'
2967	The contribution of waste heat to the global climate is 0.028 W/m2.
2970	"Global warming is mostly due to heat production by human industry since the 1800s, from nuclear power and fossil fuels, better termed hydrocarbons, – coal, oil, natural gas.
2973	Also, it's not yet clear whether changes in stratospheric water vapor are caused by a climate feedback or internal variability
2977	According to the study, as carbon levels have risen, the cold air at high altitudes over the tropics has actually grown colder.
2978	The lower temperatures at this "coldest point" have caused global water vapor levels to drop, even as carbon levels rise.
2979	Water vapor helps trap heat, and is a far the strongest of the major greenhouse gases, contributing 36–72 percent of the greenhouse effect.
2981	Thus rather than a "doomsday" cycle of runaway warming, Mother Earth appears surprisingly tolerant of carbon, decreasing atmospheric levels of water vapor -- a more effective greenhouse gas -- to compensate.
2982	Statistical analysis of the rate of warming over different periods find that warming from 1970 to 2001 is greater than the warming from both 1860 to 1880 and 1910 to 1940.
2983	Despite the logarithmic relationship between CO2 and surface temperatures, atmospheric CO2 levels are rising so fast that unless we dramatically decrease our emissions, global warming will accelerate over the 21st Century.
2986	As a result, the planet as a whole is becoming less reflective and absorbing more sunlight, which is accelerating global warming.
2989	While preventing global warming is relatively cheap, economists can't even accurately estimate the accelerating costs of climate damages if we continue with business-as-usual.
2991	Yet the cost of doing something will likely be higher than 6 per cent of GDP" (Bjorn Lomborg)
2992	The measurements of the amount of CO2 made at the Mauna Loa Observatory are accurate and uncontaminated by any emissions from the volcano.
2994	'Mauna Loa has been producing a readout which supports Manning's predetermined goal by showing steady growth in atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1959.
2997	The trend in CO2 at Mauna Loa is practically identical to the global trend because CO2 mixes well throughout the atmosphere.
3000	The influence of the volcano is easily spotted and removed, together with other even more important spurious influences.
3003	Venus is not hot because of a runaway greenhouse.
3004	"The solar system oscillates with a 60-year cycle due to the Jupiter/Saturn three-synodic cycle and to a Jupiter/Saturn beat tidal cycle...
3005	About 60% of the warming observed from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by the above natural 60-year climatic cycle during its warming phase" (Loehle and Scafetta)
3007	There seems to be evidence for a link between solar activity and water levels.
3008	However, more direct comparisons between solar activity and global temperature finds that  as the sun grew hotter or cooler, Earth's climate followed it with a 10 year lag - presumably due to the dampening effect of the ocean.
3009	Also found was that the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures ended around 1975, hence recent warming must have some other cause than solar variations.
3011	A South African paper has found a 21 year cycle synchronous with the solar cycle (Alexander 2007).
3017	Some of the regions in which  GRACE claims ice loss in East Antarctica average colder than -30°C  during the summer, and never, ever get above freezing.
3024	Unlike the simple example of positive feedback we learned in high school, the increase from every round of feedback gets smaller and smaller, in the case of the enhanced greenhouse effect.
3032	Consequently, CO2 levels at around 1,000 to 2,300 ppm were actually low enough to promote glaciation in the southern continent of Gondwana.
3034	Since rock weathering reduces atmospheric CO2, this again reinforces the scientific fact that CO2 is a strong driver of climate.
3038	Clearly, other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming."
3039	Hocker is claiming that his model shows that the long-term upward trend in CO2 is explained by temperature, when his methods actually removed the long-term trend.
3044	Thousands of coral atolls have "drowned" in the past when they were unable to grow fast enough to maintain a presence at sea level
3046	There are many lines of evidence which clearly show that the atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by humans.
3047	The clearest of these is simple accounting - humans are emitting CO2 at a rate twice as fast as the atmospheric increase (natural sinks are absorbing the other half).
3048	There is no question whatsoever that the CO2 increase is human-caused.
3049	that atmospheric CO2 increase that we observe is a product of temperature  increase, and not the other way around, meaning it is a product of  natural variation...
3051	Once natural influences, in particular the impact of El Niño and La Niña, are removed from the recent termperature record, there is no evidence of a significant change in the human contribution to climate change.
3052	"...there has been no increase in the global average surface temperature for the past 16 years" (Judith Curry and David Rose)
3056	"The observed data show that CFCs conspiring with cosmic rays most likely caused both the Antarctic ozone hole and global warming...
3058	Correspondingly, the global surface temperature has also dropped."
3059	Models and direct observations find that CFCs only contribute a fraction of the warming supplied by other greenhouse gases.
3062	This increases confidence in other peer-reviewed research predicting sea level rise of 80cm to 2 metres by 2100.
3063	'Another global warming myth comes crashing down.
3064	No warming since at least 1995, no melting glaciers and now no rising sea levels.
3066	The claim that 2.2 conventional jobs are destroyed   for  every new job created in the alternative energy industry is based on a study which relies on incorrect numbers, cherrypicked dates, faulty theory, flawed methodology, and is disproven by real-world examples.
3068	for every renewable energy job that the State manages to finance, Spain’s experience...reveals with high confidence, by two different methods, that the U.S. should expect a loss of at least 2.2 jobs on average
3069	Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.
3070	So this is a government which is proposing to put at risk our manufacturing industry, to penalise struggling families, to make a tough situation worse for millions of households right around Australia.
3072	"a paper...in Science magazine concludes that the climate sensitivity—how much the earth’s average temperature will rise as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide—likely (that is, with a 66% probability) lies in the range 1.7°C to 2.6°C, with a median value of 2.3°C.
3074	Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), in which the likely range is given as 2.0°C to 4.5°C, with a best estimate of 3.0°C" (Pat Michaels)
3075	Multiple lines of evidence indicate Greenland's ice loss is accelerating and will contribute sea level rise in the order of metres over the next few centuries.
3079	This was the case last year too, while earlier  years in the DMI analysis period (1958-2010) hardly ever shows Arctic  melt season temperatures this cold (Frank Lansner)
3082	"However, a single scientist, Dr. Ben Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, rewrote the draft at the IPCC’s request, deleting all five statements, replacing them with a single statement to the effect that a human influence on global climate was now discernible, and making some 200 consequential amendments.
3084	"the temperature increase in the second half of the 20th century could have taken place in steps driven by major ENSO events" (Jens Raunsø Jensen)
3090	A generous estimate of the energy generated by satellites is around 1 million times too small to cause global warming.
3091	Global Warming history completely coincides with the history of artificial satellites and the use of microwave frequencies from outer space.
3093	Sending oscillating microwaves from an antenna inside a vacuum through an electromagnetic field through a dielectric material, such as water, creates radio frequency heating at the molecular level
3099	"The IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, 2007, carries in three places a graph in which the Hadley Center’s global mean surface temperature anomaly dataset from 1850-2005 is displayed with four arbitrarily-chosen trend-lines overlaid upon it.
3102	...there [is] anecdotal and other evidence suggesting similar melts from 1938-43 and on other occasions.
3103	"Disasters Cost More Than Ever — But Not Because of Climate Change" (Roger Pielke Jr.)
3104	the satellite sensors show less warming in the lower troposphere (approximately 10,000 feet above the earth’s surface) than is reported by surface temperature readings.
3105	Global warming theory holds that one of the fingerprints of human-induced global warming is more rapid warming in the lower troposphere than at the surface (James Taylor)
3110	In those days you couldn’t have seen across the street for all the carbon emissions and the crap coming out of the chimneys.'
3111	Ljungqvist's millennial temperature reconstruction was very similar to Moberg et al.
3112	It also concludes that current northern hemisphere surface air temperatures are significantly higher than during the peak of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP).
3114	'What I can comment on is this prediction by Dr. Hansen: “The West Side Highway [which runs along the Hudson River] will be under water.”
3119	CO2 constitutes 80% of the non-condensing greenhouse gas forcing.
3121	"Cloud cover in models is poorly treated and inaccurately predicted.
3122	Yet clouds reflect about seventy-five watts per square meter.
3123	Given that a doubling of carbon dioxide would change the surface heat flux by only two watts per square meter, it is evident that a small change in cloud cover can strongly affect the response to carbon dioxide."
3124	the Great Barrier Reef is in fine fettle
3125	About 60% of the warming observed from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by this natural 60-year climatic cycle during its warming phase...
3127	"Skeptics hope that Postma’s alternative thermal model will lead  to the birth of a new climatology, one that actually follows the laws of  physics and properly physical modeling techniques...
3130	"There are other possible causes for climate change which could be associated with solar activity or related to variations in the temperature of the liquid core of the Earth, which is about 5,400 degrees Celsius.
3131	We don't need a high heat flow - just a high temperature for the core to affect the surface climate.
3134	Over the last decade, heatwaves are five times more likely than if there had been no global warming.
